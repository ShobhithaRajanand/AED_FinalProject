# Organ donation Management System

An organ donation management system built with Java's AWT package for the distribution of organ records across multiple cities. We developed an organ donation management system that will allow people to check the availability of organs in their area.
 
# Objective

Based on medical information and clinical tests, an organ from a specific donor is assigned to a specific recipient.
To enhance the current services provided by hospitals and healthcare systems in order to ensure that citizens receive more effective medical assistance
To raise public awareness about organ donation through camps and increase donation rates.
To raise funds in collaboration with the government and corporations.
